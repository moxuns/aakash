          <h1>Striving for Immortality</h1>
          <small>April, 2022</small>
          <p>
            There can be three probable ways we can perceive consciousness.
First, it's nothing but, just a fragment of our imagination. But the sole fact that we can imagine rules this out.
Second, it's some spiritual thing out of normal people's understanding.
And, third, it's created due to firing of neurons.

Since, we have already dismissed the first case, let's get to the second one. Isn't it scary. Say consciousness is some spiritual thing which would mean that it probably existed before I was born and will exist after my death. That means our consciousness is immortal. Thinking about it gives me two kinds of thoughts. One of fear and other of excitement. But, if this is truly the case, I don't have anything to say, because then it is above my current understandings.

So, let's move to the third.
Say it's created due to the firing of neurons and there is nothing spiritual about it. Which would mean it didn't exist before me and won't exist after me. Which for me can be good, but only if we could choose when it stops existing. See, we could not choose our birth-dates but, we should be able to choose our death-dates. We should strive for immortality.

          <h1>Financial Independence</h1>
          <small>June, 2022</small>
          <p>
            Have you ever thought about how much you need to become financially independent in India?

A fresher out of an engineering college in India comes out with an average annual salary of around 6-9lakh. Say, he/she works for around 40 years.
So, the total amount that he will earn would be 40Ã—7.5lakh=3crore rupees.

And in order to earn 3 crore you need just one customer whom you can sell a property at 6 crore after buying the property yourself at a cost of 3 crore rupees, giving you a profit of rupees 3 crores.
Same amount that an engineering graduate would earn in his lifetime you have earned in a single transaction in a business. You can say that there will be increments in his salary, but then we will also have to adjust for annual inflation, interest rate on your 3 crore investment (assuming you don't spend all your profit at once and keep living a normal life). And the new business you could start with that amount.

So yeah, it really isn't that hard to become financially independent.

1 customer giving you a profit of 3 crores.
2 customers giving you a profit of 1.5 crores each.
3 of them giving you 1 crore each.
10 of them giving you 30 lakh each.
30 of them giving you 10 lakh each.
100 of them giving you 3 lakh each.
1,000 of them giving you 30,000 each.
10,000 of them giving you a profit of 3,000 rupees each.

Any of the above options will make you financially independent or atleast make you as much an engineer.

Go ahead, do the hard work of building a product, marketing that product successfully to acquire customers and become financially independent.
Don't wait. Time is running out.

Best of luck.
